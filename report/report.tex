%% Abstract
%% Note: \begin{abstract}...\end{abstract} environment must come

\begin{abstract}
The Algorand consensus protocol is at the core of the Algorand platform for secure and decentralized digital currencies and transactions. In this report, we describe our effort to model and formally verify the Algorand consensus protocol in the Coq proof assistant. We give an overview of the protocol, outline our model of the protocol as a state transition system, and describe how its properties are formalized and proved. A key contribution of this work is the elucidation of the assumptions under which the main safety property of the protocol holds. The Coq source files are available at:\\
