\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this report, we described a complete model of the Algorand consensus protocol in Coq. We also outlined the statement and machine-checkable proof of the asynchronous safety theorem, a key property of the Algorand protocol, while also highlighting the assumptions under which the theorem holds. Our formal proof of safety (along with other lemmas leading up to it) gives additional assurance in the correctness of the protocol.

Concerning future efforts, the model we developed as part of this effort is generic in that it captures the dynamics of the Algorand consensus protocol in a way that is orthogonal to the properties that we verify about it. This means that the model can be readily used to verify other properties of the protocol beyond asynchronous safety, including most importantly \emph{liveness}~\cite{Chen2019}. In fact, we anticipate that many of the smaller results shown about the protocol and used in the proof of safety will also constitute essential ingredients of a liveness proving effort. Nevertheless, proving liveness will likely require showing many additional results, especially related to timely message delivery and network partitioning, some of which were not needed for the safety argument.
