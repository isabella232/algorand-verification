\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The model we developed as part of this effort is generic, in that it captures the dynamics of the Algorand consensus protocol in a way that is orthogonal to the properties that we verify about it. This means that the model can be readily used to verify other properties of the system beyond asynchronous safety, including most importantly liveness. In fact, we anticipate that many of the smaller results shown about the protocol and used in the proof of safety will also constitute essential ingredients of the liveness proving effort. Nevertheless, proving liveness will probably require showing additional results, especially those related to timely message delivery and networking partitioning, which were not necessarily needed for the safety argument. But the model already has these components (time, message delays and network partitioning) and going into investigating liveness (and perhaps other properties) should be a seamless continuation of the effort involved in this project.
